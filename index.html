   <h1>Break Timer in Python</h1>

   <p>This repo contains the files for a program that reminds a computer user to take a break every two hours</p>
   <p>This is the first program I'm writing in Python, the first actual repo I'm manually creating in Github, and the first repo I'll be committing to via the Github package in Atom... So hopefully I can figure out how to make this all work.
